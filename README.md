I opted for the easy create option because I don't want to spend time configuring it manually, especially since this is only for testing purposes.

After some time, I discovered my mistakeâ€”it took me 4 hours, quite unusual! I unintentionally created a MySQL Aurora DB instead of an RDS MySQL. Now, I've set up a new DB. Let's see how it goes...
